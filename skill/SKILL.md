name: paired
description: Bridge an OpenClaw agent to the user's own phone via Bluetooth and ADB-over-USB. Provides SMS receive (MAP/MNS), SMS send (ADB autosend), outgoing calls (HFP), incoming-call alerts, contacts pull (PBAP), media control (AVRCP), file transfer (OBEX), and PAN tethering — all driving the user's actual paired phone. Zero recurring cost, no Twilio/Telnyx/Vapi, no rented numbers. Triggers on phrases like "send SMS", "text someone", "call my phone", "make a call", "what's on my phone", "my contacts", "phone contacts", "play music", "pause", "next track", "send file to phone", "tether", "paired devices", "is my phone connected", "Bluetooth", "BT", "/sms", "/phone", "ofono", "AVRCP", "MAP". Configuration lives in ~/.config/paired/paired.conf (phone MAC, adapter, trusted numbers list). Always read the config before acting; never hardcode phone identifiers.

  notes: |
    This skill controls the user's real phone. It is intended for use on a Linux
    host that the user owns, paired to a phone the user owns, with Telegram bot
    credentials the user controls. It is not safe to expose any of these channels
    to untrusted parties. The trusted-numbers allowlist gates outgoing SMS/calls;
    keep it short and review it regularly.

## Execution context

You are running on a Linux host with BlueZ + ofono installed and a phone paired over Bluetooth. The skill ships:

- **Low-level primitives** at `skill/bin/bt-*.py` — BlueZ/ofono/ADB direct interfaces
- **High-level wrappers** at `skill/wrappers/paired-*.py` — JSON-clean interfaces designed for agents to call
- **Systemd unit files** at `skill/systemd/*.service.txt` — for persistent listeners (SMS push, call watch, command hook). The `.txt` suffix is a packaging convention; rename to `.service` when copying into `~/.config/systemd/user/` (see Installation below).

## Installation

After `clawhub install paired`:

```bash
# 1. Symlink (or copy) the bin/ and wrappers/ scripts into ~/bin/, dropping .py from filenames
#    so the user/agent can invoke `paired-sms-send` rather than `paired-sms-send.py`.
mkdir -p ~/bin
for f in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/bin/*.py; do
  ln -sf "$f" ~/bin/"$(basename "$f" .py)"
done
for f in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/wrappers/*.py; do
  ln -sf "$f" ~/bin/"$(basename "$f" .py)"
done
for f in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/wrappers/*.sh; do
  ln -sf "$f" ~/bin/"$(basename "$f" .sh)"
done
chmod +x ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/bin/*.py \
         ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/wrappers/*.py \
         ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/wrappers/*.sh

# 2. Optional: enable systemd user services. Strip the .txt suffix on copy.
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
for f in ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/paired/systemd/*.service.txt; do
  cp "$f" ~/.config/systemd/user/"$(basename "$f" .txt)"
done
systemctl --user daemon-reload

# 3. One-time inbox HMAC key generation (required for paired-inbox-hook)
paired-inbox-hook --keygen

# 4. Optional: enable the inbox hook (HMAC-signed command dispatcher)
systemctl --user enable --now paired-inbox-hook.service
```

The `.py`, `.sh`, and `.service.txt` extensions exist to satisfy the ClawHub packaging text-file allowlist; on disk in your `~/bin/` and `~/.config/systemd/user/` they should be the unsuffixed names referenced throughout this document.

When reasoning about a phone task, prefer the high-level `paired-*` wrappers — they handle trust checks, error formatting, and JSON output. Drop to `bt-*` only for diagnostic or low-level work. **The low-level `bt-call` and `bt-sms` primitives now also enforce the trusted-numbers allowlist** (since v1.0.4) and refuse to dial/SMS unlisted numbers unless `--confirm` is passed.

**Acting on the world vs. answering questions:** for status queries ("is my phone connected?", "any new SMS?"), running the tool and reporting the result is the right call. For high-impact actions (sending SMS, dialling calls, pairing new devices, unlocking the phone), confirm with the user first unless the request is unambiguous and the destination is on the trusted-numbers allowlist.

**Phone identity comes from `~/.config/paired/paired.conf`**, key `phone_bt_mac`. If a command needs the phone's MAC, read it from the config rather than asking the user. If the config is missing, tell the user to copy `paired.conf.example` and fill in the MAC.

## Most-used commands

### Stack health and discovery

```bash
~/bin/bt-test                              # 10-check stack health (one-shot diagnostic)
~/bin/bt-adapters                          # list HCI adapters
~/bin/bt-list --paired                     # paired devices with CONN/PAIR/TRUST status
~/bin/bt-list --connected                  # only currently-connected
~/bin/bt-list --scan 10                    # 10-second scan for nearby
~/bin/bt-info <MAC>                        # full device detail (UUIDs, RSSI, profiles)
~/bin/bt-recover                           # USB-reset adapter if hung
```

### Pairing and connection

```bash
~/bin/bt-pair <MAC>                        # initiate pairing (passkey via bt-agent)
~/bin/bt-pair <MAC> --connect              # pair + trust + connect in one step
~/bin/bt-connect <MAC>                     # connect to an already-paired device
~/bin/bt-disconnect <MAC>
~/bin/bt-trust <MAC> | ~/bin/bt-untrust <MAC>
~/bin/bt-forget <MAC>                      # remove pairing entirely
```

### Phone — SMS

Receive (read-only via Bluetooth, fully working on most phones):

```bash
~/bin/paired-sms-watch --status            # is the MNS push daemon running?
~/bin/paired-sms-watch --last 10           # last 10 SMS the daemon caught
~/bin/bt-sms-list --map <MAC> --max 10     # explicit MAP read of recent
~/bin/bt-adb-sms-list --limit 10           # ADB read of inbox (works while phone is locked)
~/bin/bt-adb-sms-list --sent --limit 10    # sent folder
```

Send (via ADB-over-USB autosend — Bluetooth MAP send is blocked on most Samsung firmware):

```bash
~/bin/paired-sms-send <NUMBER> "<text>" --json
# Pass --auto-unlock to dismiss the lock screen using the PIN at
# ~/.config/paired/pin (mode 0600 enforced). Pass --relock to re-lock after.
# Without --auto-unlock, the tool returns error=keyguard_locked when phone is locked.
```

Telegram command shortcut: when the user types `/sms NUMBER text` in Telegram, run `~/bin/paired-sms-send NUMBER "text" --json` and report the JSON result. Quote the entire body as one argument.

### Phone — calls (HFP via ofono)

```bash
~/bin/paired-call status --json            # active calls in structured form
~/bin/paired-call dial <NUMBER>            # initiate outbound
~/bin/paired-call answer                   # accept incoming
~/bin/paired-call hangup                   # end all calls
~/bin/paired-call-and-speak <NUMBER> "<msg>" # dial + speak via Tasker TTS (see limits)
~/bin/bt-modems --full                     # ofono modem state, network registration
~/bin/paired-call-watch --last 10          # last 10 incoming calls caught by daemon
~/bin/paired-call-watch --status           # is the call watcher daemon running?
```

Real-time incoming-call alerts run as a systemd user service (`paired-call-watch.service`) — caught calls go to the user's Telegram via `paired-call-watch-tg-hook` with sender + trust-status info.

### Phone — Telegram command vocabulary (deterministic, bypasses LLM)

`paired-sms-command-hook.service` reads commands from a dedicated, append-only inbox at `~/.openclaw/paired/inbox/` (NOT from raw agent session logs — see Security model below) and dispatches recognised commands without invoking the LLM:

| Telegram command | Action | Trust check | Underlying call |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/sms <num> <body>` | Send SMS via ADB | **trusted-numbers allowlist required** (or `--confirm`) | `paired-sms-send` |
| `/phone <num>` | Dial outbound | **trusted-numbers allowlist required** (or `--confirm`) | `paired-call dial` |
| `/phone <num> <msg>` | Dial + speak via Tasker TTS, optional SMS fallback | **trusted-numbers allowlist required** | `paired-call-and-speak` |
| `/phone <num> attach <path>` | Dial + speak file content | **trusted-numbers allowlist required** | as above |
| `/phone hangup` (or `/phone end`) | End all active calls | none | `paired-call hangup` |
| `/phone status` | Active call state | none | `paired-call status` |

Trusted list at `~/.config/paired/trusted-numbers.conf` — managed via `~/bin/paired-trusted add | remove | list`. UK number normalization: `+44`, `0044`, `44`, and `07` formats all match the same entry. **An empty trusted-numbers file blocks all outgoing SMS and calls except for explicit `--confirm` invocations.** This is the safe default — fill the file in deliberately.

**SMS fallback for `/phone <num> <msg>`:** TTS during calls is blocked on some phone firmware (notably Samsung — see "Known phone-side limits" below). When TTS-during-call fails, the wrapper *can* also send an SMS with the same body so the recipient still gets the message. This is **opt-in per invocation** — pass `--with-sms-fallback` to enable it. Without that flag, a TTS failure returns an error and the wrapper does not send any SMS. The Telegram reply notes the chosen behaviour explicitly: "📞 TTS only" or "📞 TTS + 📨 SMS fallback (best-effort)".

### Security model (read this before enabling persistent services)

This skill runs **persistent systemd services** that can dispatch phone actions automatically:

- `paired-sms-watch.service` — listens for incoming SMS (via Bluetooth MAP-MNS), forwards alerts to Telegram. Read-only with respect to the phone.
- `paired-call-watch.service` — listens for incoming calls (via ofono D-Bus), forwards alerts to Telegram. Read-only.
- `paired-sms-command-hook.service` — reads command messages from `~/.openclaw/paired/inbox/`, dispatches recognised commands. **This is the surface that can act.** It accepts commands ONLY from a directory the user controls, with a per-message HMAC signature using a secret in `~/.config/paired/inbox.key` (mode 0600). Commands from any other source — raw session logs, the agent's chat memory, an SMS body, etc. — are NOT dispatched.

**Why the inbox model:** earlier versions of this skill parsed the agent's session JSONL log directly. That made the session log a control surface — anything that landed in it (including unfiltered text from incoming SMS/calls) was a potential command source. The inbox model isolates the dispatch surface to messages the user (or a trusted bot relay) explicitly drops into the inbox dir, signed with the inbox key.

**To stop all persistent services in one go:**

```bash
systemctl --user stop paired-sms-watch paired-call-watch paired-sms-command-hook
systemctl --user disable paired-sms-watch paired-call-watch paired-sms-command-hook
```

### Phone — contacts (PBAP)

```bash
~/bin/bt-contacts <MAC> --max 10           # list 10 contacts
~/bin/bt-contacts <MAC> --pull             # pull entire phonebook to ~/Downloads/bluetooth/<mac>.vcf
~/bin/bt-contacts <MAC> --search "name"    # search by name
```

### Phone — media (AVRCP via BT, fallback to ADB)

```bash
~/bin/paired-media status --json           # current track + status (auto BT/ADB transport)
~/bin/paired-media play | pause | next | prev | stop
~/bin/paired-media volume 50               # set BT volume 0-100
~/bin/paired-media current                 # what's playing right now
```

Auto-detects connected phone, picks BT/AVRCP first then falls back to ADB media controller.

### File transfer (OBEX)

```bash
~/bin/bt-send <FILE> <MAC>                 # push file to phone
~/bin/bt-receive                           # listen for incoming pushes (saves to ~/Downloads/bluetooth/)
~/bin/bt-browse <MAC>                      # OBEX-FTP browse (vendor-dependent)
```

### Network (PAN)

```bash
~/bin/bt-pan up <MAC>                      # connect as NAP client (phone-side BT-tethering must be ON)
~/bin/bt-pan down                          # disconnect
~/bin/bt-pan status                        # show bnep0 state
```

### GATT / BLE

```bash
~/bin/bt-gatt-tree <MAC>                   # enumerate services + characteristics
~/bin/bt-gatt-read <MAC> <UUID>            # read a characteristic
~/bin/bt-gatt-write <MAC> <UUID> <HEX>     # write a characteristic
```

### Audio

```bash
~/bin/bt-audio <MAC> --info                # available profiles
~/bin/bt-volume <MAC>                      # current volume
~/bin/bt-play <FILE> <MAC>                 # play file through BT speaker
```

## LLM-drafted SMS reply (showcase feature, opt-in)

When an SMS arrives whose body starts with the phrase set in `paired.conf[llm_trigger]` (default: `"Hi Agent,"`) **and** the sender is on the `paired.conf[llm_trigger_whitelist]`, `paired-respond` will:

1. Strip the trigger prefix
2. Call the configured LLM (Gemini / OpenAI / local) with a tight system prompt
3. Post a richer Telegram alert containing sender, original question, drafted reply, and a tap-to-copy `/sms` command

The user decides whether to send the draft by tapping the `/sms` line. **No automatic SMS reply.** Empty whitelist disables the feature. Logs at `~/.paired/sms-respond.log`.

## Common phrasings → tool mapping

- "Stack health?" → `~/bin/bt-test`
- "What's paired?" / "What devices?" → `~/bin/bt-list --paired`
- "Is my phone connected?" → `~/bin/bt-list --connected | grep -i <phone-label>`
- "Pair with X" → `~/bin/bt-pair X --connect`
- "Network signal?" → `~/bin/bt-modems --full`
- "Any new SMS?" / "Watch SMS" → `~/bin/paired-sms-watch --last 5`
- "Is SMS watcher running?" → `~/bin/paired-sms-watch --status`
- `/sms NUMBER text` → `~/bin/paired-sms-send NUMBER "text" --json`
- "Reply to that SMS with X" → user provides text; you call `paired-sms-send LAST_SENDER "X" --json`. Get LAST_SENDER from the most recent `~/.paired/sms-events.jsonl` entry.
- "Call NUMBER" → `~/bin/paired-call dial NUMBER --json`
- "Hang up" → `~/bin/paired-call hangup --json`
- "Pause music" / "play music" / "next song" → `~/bin/paired-media pause/play/next`
- "What's playing?" → `~/bin/paired-media current`

## Known phone-side limits (clean errors, not bugs)

These are **phone-firmware constraints, not skill bugs**. The tools return clean errors and the docs explain workarounds.

### Samsung firmware (Note 8/9/10/20, S-series tested through OneUI 12)

- **SMS-send via Bluetooth (HFP / MAP) is blocked.** Samsung firmware does not implement `MAP UpdateInbox` and ofono SMS-send returns access-denied. Workaround: use `paired-sms-send` (ADB-over-USB autosend) — fully working.
- **In-call TTS is blocked at the audio policy level.** Samsung Telecom holds `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_EXCLUSIVE | AUDIOFOCUS_FLAG_LOCK` for the entire ring+call lifecycle. No third-party app (Tasker included) can inject audio into the call audio path. The `paired-call-and-speak` tool runs but the recipient hears silence — **SMS fail-soft compensates** (the message body is also sent as SMS, recipient guaranteed to receive). On non-Samsung devices (Pixel/AOSP, LineageOS, rooted) this is expected to work normally.
- **OBEX-FTP browse not advertised.** Use `bt-send` to push files instead.

### ofono + PipeWire (Debian 13, Ubuntu 24.04)

- **Two-way SCO audio in calls is blocked.** ofono 2.16 + PipeWire 1.4.x + libspa-bluetooth 1.4.x do not cooperate for HFP audio routing on current Debian. Outgoing calls work — the audio just routes through the phone earpiece, not the host's speaker/mic. Tested on both BCM43142 BT 4.0 and RTL8761B BT 5.1 adapters. `paired-sco-agent` is shipped as experimental — see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **A2DP source profile (phone music → host speaker)** is blocked by the same conflict. Receive (host as sink) works; source does not.

### General

- The "Hi Agent," LLM trigger is **opt-in** via `paired.conf` and bound to a **whitelist**. Default config has the whitelist empty, which keeps the feature off until the user explicitly trusts a number.
- Auto-unlock is **opt-in only**. Storing a phone PIN on the host is a security trade — see `paired.conf.example` for the warning.

## Architecture notes

- ofono owns HFP. PipeWire bluez monitor loaded but A2DP-source profile blocked by ofono/PipeWire HFP backend conflict — known trade-off, documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- `bt-agent.service` runs as a system service to handle pairing PIN/passkey requests.
- The `paired-*` wrappers are the agent-facing interface; the underlying `bt-*` tools are CLI primitives that wrap BlueZ D-Bus and ofono D-Bus directly. Wrappers add JSON output, trust gating, fail-soft behaviour, and Telegram integration.

## Hardware compatibility

See `docs/HARDWARE-COMPATIBILITY.md` for the full matrix. Tested combinations:

| Phone | Android | What works | What's blocked |
|---|---|---|---|
| Samsung Note 9 | 10 / OneUI 12 | Pairing, contacts, SMS receive, outgoing calls, media, file push, PAN, ADB SMS send | In-call TTS, two-way SCO, MAP send, A2DP source |

| Adapter | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|
| BCM43142A0 | Internal BT 4.0 | All features tested working |
| RTL8761B | USB BT 5.1 | All features tested working |

## Setup checklist (for first-time users)

1. **Pair your phone:**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/bt-list --scan 10                # find your phone in the scan output
   ~/bin/bt-pair <MAC> --connect          # pair, trust, connect
   ```

2. **Write your config:**
   ```bash
   cp config-templates/paired.conf.example ~/.config/paired/paired.conf
   $EDITOR ~/.config/paired/paired.conf   # set phone_bt_mac, adapter, etc.
   ```

3. **Set up the trusted-numbers list (optional, recommended):**
   ```bash
   cp config-templates/trusted-numbers.conf.example ~/.config/paired/trusted-numbers.conf
   ~/bin/paired-trusted add 07911123456 "main mobile"
   ~/bin/paired-trusted list
   ```

4. **Enable the systemd user services you want:**
   ```bash
   systemctl --user enable --now paired-sms-watch.service       # real-time SMS push
   systemctl --user enable --now paired-call-watch.service      # incoming call alerts
   systemctl --user enable --now paired-sms-command-hook.service # /sms /phone Telegram commands
   ```

5. **Verify:**
   ```bash
   ~/bin/bt-test                          # 10-check stack health
   ```

If everything's green, the agent is ready to use the skill.
